===============================================
SETUP INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOUR SUI WALLET PROJECT
===============================================

PREREQUISITES:
--------------
1. Node.js (version 18.x or higher)
   Download from: https://nodejs.org/

2. Git (to clone your repository)
   Download from: https://git-scm.com/

3. A code editor (VS Code recommended)
   Download from: https://code.visualstudio.com/


INSTALLATION STEPS:
-------------------

Step 1: Clone Your Repository
------------------------------
Open your terminal/command prompt and run:

    git clone <your-github-repository-url>
    cd <your-project-folder-name>


Step 2: Install Dependencies
-----------------------------
You need to install a package manager first. You can use either npm (comes with Node.js), yarn, or pnpm.

IMPORTANT: If you encounter dependency conflicts, use --legacy-peer-deps flag:

Option A - Using npm (comes with Node.js):
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps

Option B - Using pnpm (recommended for faster installs):
    npm install -g pnpm
    pnpm install

Option C - Using yarn:
    npm install -g yarn
    yarn install


Step 3: Run the Development Server
-----------------------------------
After installation is complete, start the development server:

Using npm:
    npm run dev

Using pnpm:
    pnpm dev

Using yarn:
    yarn dev


Step 4: View Your Application
------------------------------
Open your browser and navigate to:
    http://localhost:3000

Your landing page should now be visible!


ADDITIONAL COMMANDS:
--------------------

Build for production:
    npm run build    (or pnpm build / yarn build)

Start production server:
    npm start        (or pnpm start / yarn start)

Run linter:
    npm run lint     (or pnpm lint / yarn lint)


TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------

Issue: "Port 3000 is already in use"
Solution: Either close the app using port 3000, or start the dev server on a different port:
    npm run dev -- -p 3001

Issue: "Module not found" errors
Solution: Delete node_modules and reinstall:
    rm -rf node_modules
    npm install

Issue: TypeScript errors during build
Solution: The project has "ignoreBuildErrors: true" in next.config.mjs, so builds should succeed anyway


WHAT'S BEEN UPDATED:
--------------------
Your landing page now features:
- Left side: Informative content about the Sui ecosystem with three feature highlights
- Right side: Wallet connection card (Connect/Create tabs)
- Responsive design that works on mobile (stacks vertically) and desktop (side-by-side)
- Animated wavy background with cyan/blue/teal gradient colors
- Professional, modern design optimized for blockchain/web3 aesthetics


DEPENDENCIES INCLUDED:
----------------------
- Next.js 14 (React framework)
- TypeScript (type safety)
- Tailwind CSS v4 (styling)
- Radix UI (accessible UI components)
- Lucide React (icons)
- React Hook Form (form handling)
- simplex-noise (wavy background animation)

- Images are stored in public/images/design-mode/
- The Sui logo spinning animation is defined in app/globals.css
